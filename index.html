    <h1>Pavel Prokhorov Page</h1>
    <p>I find it interesting that everyone keeps talking about how <strong>hard</strong> it is to
       make a living. Like borderline <strong>impossible</strong>. And yet I always see <a href="https://platform.cstatic-  images.com/medium/in/v2/stock_photos/ecbc4cd8-5926-4f8e-b320-56d6e4e14665/ef196f60-908e-47e3-a94a-8ee9e06064eb.png">cars</a> 
       driving around that <strong>presumably</strong> cost a lot of money to buy, with <strong>presumably</strong>
       well-off people driving them. They go every which way and you'd be <strong>hard-
       pressed</strong> to see the same one twice-- so is it possible to make a <strong>decent</strong>
       living after all? I assume not <strong>everyone</strong> driving around is well-off but 
       <strong>surely</strong> it can't be all <strong>that</strong> bad. Here's hoping.
